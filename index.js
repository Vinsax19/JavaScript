// A variable is a way to store and manipulate data
/* Ways of declaring variables are
var myName = "Alvin" "var is a way to declare a variable that is going to be used through out your program, it can be changed later....."
let ourName = "Vin music" "let will only be used within the scope in which it is declared "
const pi = 3.14  "const is a variable that should never change or it can't be changed"


var a; 'this is just declaring a variable'
var b = 2; 'this is declaring and assigning in one'

SUBTRACTION OPERATOR: -
DIVISION OPERATOR: /
MULTIPLICATION OPERATOR: *
REMAINDER OPPERATOR: %
COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGUMENTED ADDITION:
var a = 3;

a = a + 12;
    OR
a += 12; //Shorthand  

COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGUMENTED SUBTRACTION:
var a = 3;

a = a - 12;
    OR
a -= 12; //Shorthand  

COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGUMENTED MULTIPLICATION:
var a = 3;

a = a * 12;
    OR
a *= 12; //Shorthand  

COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGUMENTED DIVISION:
var a = 3;

a = a / 12;
    OR
a /= 12; //Shorthand  



INCREMENTING A NUMBER

myVar = 87;
myVar = myVar + 1;
myVar++; //shorthand to incrementing 
console.log(myVar)

DECREMENTING A NUMBER
myVar = 87;
myVar = myVar - 1;
    OR
myVar--; // shorthand for decrementing    

DECLARING STRING VARIABLES
myFirstName = "Alvin"; The words/characters in the quotation mark are called strings literals

ESCAPING LITERAL QUOTES IN STRINGS
var myStr = "I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes"";
To fix the problem above, you use the escape character which is a back slash "\"
It is used by putting the back slash in the front of each character you wan escape
var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"";
You can also avoid the problem by using single quotes to surround the string i.e 'I am a "double quoted" string in a "single quote"';

There are things you can escape also for example
\' single quote
\"  double quote
\\  backslash
\n  newline
\r  carriage return
\t  tab
\b  backspace
\f  form feed

CONCATENATION WITH PLUS OPERATOR
myVar = "i come first"  + " I come second"

CONCATENATION WITH PLUS EQUALS OPERATOR
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

CONSTRUCTING STRINGS WITH VARIABLE
var myName = "Alvin";
var ourStr = "Hey, my name is " + myName + ", how are you?";
